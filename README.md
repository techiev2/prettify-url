prettify-url
============

Removes the ugly from some URLs, causing them to look nicer in links to other 
people. This isn't meant to make all URLs suddenly beautiful, but instead help 
bring us closer to the concept that [URLs are for People, not Computers](http://www.not-implemented.com/urls-are-for-people-not-computers/).

Currently Supports
------------------

 * Google Web Search (most support, disable Google Instant for full support)
  
Support for many other providers coming as I see URLs that make me angry.
